## Writing ml & dl algos from scratch for educational purposes and fun :) 

Inspired by Karpathy's youtube playlist, I decided to embark on a quest to work on the foundational building blocks of machine learning. 
Working from the foundations and upwards has always been a very constructive experience for me. Low level implementations provide unique insights and challenges, that usually hide behind frameworks and APIs. This is my quest towards a deeper understanding of the field I feel so passionate of.

I strive to work on the solutions without external support as much as possible. When stuck, I will consult external resources to get hints, but will avoid pasting other people's code. Every feedback is welcomed :)

Repo is under ongoing construction. 


### Implemented:


##### architectures
- Neuron
- Feedforward Net

##### engine 
- A Tensor class
- The Backpropagation algorithm
